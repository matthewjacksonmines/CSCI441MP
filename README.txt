===================================================| Mid-Term Project |===================================================


This has been the first time we worked on a project as a team and not individually. We used all the knowledge we obtained 
during the semester up until this moment, and created a 3D world filled with features and functionality we have seen on class.

In this world, all the characters chose the same metal, and now they are part of a guild. There are four heroes, all of them 
are different, with their aspect and animations, and they can all be controlled and moved around the world. Apart from the 
heroes, this world is not empty, it has swaying grass, pine trees, elevation with a hill and a shiny sun above.
All of this can be seen from different perspective cameras. An arc-ball camera around the hero being controlled, a free camera 
to move freely around the world, as well as a picture-in-picture first person camera view of the hero. 
This world has some good custom shaders, lighting and textures. Lights are created with the Phong Illumination model using 
three different lights: directional which gives even light for all the world, a point light which coincides with our sun, and 
a spotlight above the heroes. The textures allow to see beyond a flat color and set a beautiful sky on the horizon on this world.


----- CONTROLS ------

· WASD / arrow keys --> Hero movement
· Space --> Camera zoom in
· Space + shift --> Camera zoom out
· C --> Toggle camera from free to arc-ball
· V --> Toggle first person viewport
· P --> Change hero being controlled


----- COMPILATION ------

Depending on the operating system, include folder and CMakeList.txt file, the build and compilation might differ. 
We recommend checking that all required libraries are included and the CMakeLists.txt paths are correct.



----- Distribution of responsibilities ------

- Santiago : Project skeleton, hero interface, objects around the world, cameras and illumination.
- Matt : Texturing, heroes compatibility, code merging and debugging.
- Jacob : World elevation.



- How long did this assignment take you?
This is always a great question. In our case, it should have taken more time, we contacted as a team quite late, but 
we ended up getting the structure pretty quick to then divide the work on around three days. Planning started last 
Friday on the lab, then the skeleton and some core features were implemented throughout the weekend. From Monday to Thursday 
was the heavy workload, everyone was doing different things without merging anything, and finally it got somehow completed 
last minute (actually late) to be submitted.
Total time might have been around five or six days.



- How much did the lab help you for this assignment?
Labs were crucial to implement most features in this project. The skeleton was based on many code and techniques we used in 
various labs, we use examples and everything we learned on class to make all the parts possible. So yes, they were really 
helpful to get this project started and go even further.

It helped a 9 out of 10.



- How fun was this assignment?
It was definitely fun, but it would have been even more fun if we had time to work on it with no pressure, I think 
that was our main problem as a team. Aside from that, it is an awesome way to practice, understand and learn while 
making something that sometimes feels like playing video games.

We give it a 8.5 out of 10.
