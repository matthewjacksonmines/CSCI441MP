------------------------------------- Assignment 3 - Begin the Transformation --------------------------------------

In this assigment we have created our own entire 3D world, not yet very detailed, but still a very interesting
and fun creation.
I created my hero in 3D, Daglas, using our CSCI441 library with an organized hierarchy, shaders
and illumination to make everything shine. To move around the world I implemented an arc-ball camera which fixed
look at point is centered at Daglas. You can zoom in and out and also move yaw and pitch with the mouse.
Apart from the model and camera, there is also animation and interaction with the keyboard. I implemented a constant
animation that brings Daglas to life as well as a moving animation to make walking more realistic.
The world around is not very big but at least has some grass and pine trees, similar to the ones you can see
in the mountains of Colorado.


- How long did this assignment take you?
I should have planned earlier for this assigment, becasue it does take a while. I started working on Wednesday
October 22nd and could simply create the structure of the project. Then on Thursday I started working on the
arc-ball camera and bounds. On Friday and this last weekend, I created Daglas and the full Phong Illumination model.
And yesterday I fixed my rotation and created one animation. I should have submitted this assigment one day before
but I figured out on Monday that I was not going to have enough time to submit it properly, so I decided to finish
it one day late. This allowed me to finish my animations and create the world today, and I think it was a good
decision, I took my time and did things right. Rushing is never good.


- How much did the lab help you for this assignment?
Labs were crucial for this assigment. First of all, I used lab05 as a skeleton to start coding, and that was very
helpful. But it was not just the code I had, also the skills we learned thanks to having a hands-on experience on
what we saw on class.

It helped a 9 out of 10.


- How fun was this assignment?
It was awesome, I loved creating Daglas and making it a little 3D character to play with. I could imagine how
solo video game developers might be feeling while creating their projects, it feels like a fun time playing with
code, math and graphics. I think the most interesting and fun thing is the fact that you get to see right away
what you just created, which is fantastic and is not always possible. I wish I have done this assignment with
a bit more time to enjoy it even more.

My score : 9.5 out of 10.
